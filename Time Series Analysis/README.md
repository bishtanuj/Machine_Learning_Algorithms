# Time Series Analysis

* A time series analysis is a stream of quantitive values obtained at successive time intervals.
* Time series analysis is a statistical method to analyze the past data within a given duration of time to forecast the future. It comprises of ordered sequence of data at equally spaced interval.
* Time series are very frequntly plotted via line charts, which can either be univariate or multivariate, as well as linear or non-linear in nature.


## Component of Time Series Analysis
* The reasons or forces that change the attributes of a time series are known as the components of time series.
* The following are the components of time series - <br>
&emsp; 1. Trend <br>
&emsp; 2. Seasonal Variations <br> 
&emsp; 3. Cyclical Variations <br>
&emsp; 4. Random or Irregular Movements


### Trend
- Trend shows a common tendency of data.
- It may move upward or increase or go downward or decrese over a certain, long period of time.
- The trend is a stable and long-term general tendency of movement of the data.
- To be a trend, it is not mandatory for the data to move in the same direction.
- A trend can be either linear or non-linear.


### Seasonal Variations
- Seasonal variations can be clearly seen in some cases of man-made conventions.
- The festivals, customs, fashions, habits, and various occasions, such as weddings impact the seasonal variations. As increase in business in business during seasonal variation period should not be considered a better business condition.


### Cyclical Variations
- Variations in time series that occur themselves for the span of more than a year are called Cyclical Variations.
- Such oscillatory movements of time series often have a duration of more than a year. One complete period of operation is called either a cycle or a 'Business Cycle'.
- Cyclic Variations contain four phases and they are as follows:
&emsp; 1. Prosperity
&emsp; 2. Recession
&emsp; 3. Depression
&emsp; 4. Recovery
