# DECISION TREE
A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consisits of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.

## Types of Decision Tree
There are following types of decision tree algorithms:
1. **ID3:** Stands for "Iterative Dichotomiser 3", developed by Ross Quinlan. This algorithm leverages entropy and information gain as metrics to evaluate candidate splits.
2. **C4.5:** This algorithm is considered a later iteration of ID3, which was developed by Quinlan. It can use information gain or gain ratios to evaluate split points within the decision trees.
