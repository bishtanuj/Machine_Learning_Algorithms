# Neural Networks

> _Neural networks are fascinating computational models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain._

_Neural networks are machine learning models that process and learn from data by simulating interconnected nodes (neurons). These networks enable tasks such as **pattern recognition** and **decision making**. Unlike traditional algorithms with pre-programmed rules, neural networks extract identifying features directly from data._

### How do neural network work?
- Key components of a neural network:
    - **Neurons**: These are the basic processing units. They receive inputs, apply activation functions, and produce outputs.
    - **Connections**: Neurons are interconnected via weighted connections.
