# _Neural Networks_

> _Neural networks are fascinating computational models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain._

_Neural networks are machine learning models that process and learn from data by simulating interconnected nodes (neurons). These networks enable tasks such as **pattern recognition** and **decision making**. Unlike traditional algorithms with pre-programmed rules, neural networks extract identifying features directly from data._

### How do neural network work?
- Key components of a neural network:
    - **Neurons**: These are the basic processing units. They receive inputs, apply activation functions, and produce outputs.
    - **Connections**: Neurons are interconnected via weighted connections.
    - **Weights and Biases**: These regulate information transfer between neurons.
    - **Activation Functions**: Determine whether the neuron "fires" based on its input.
    - **Learning Rule**: Adjusts weights and biases during training.
 
- The process:
    - **Input Computation**: Neurons receive input data.
    - **Output Generation**: Neurons process the input and produce an output.
    - **Iterative Refinement**: The network adjusts weights and biases to improve performance over time.
 
### Types of neural networks
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
