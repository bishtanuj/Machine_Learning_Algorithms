# _Neural Networks_

> _Neural networks are fascinating computational models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain._

_Neural networks are machine learning models that process and learn from data by simulating interconnected nodes (neurons). These networks enable tasks such as **pattern recognition** and **decision making**. Unlike traditional algorithms with pre-programmed rules, neural networks extract identifying features directly from data._

### How do neural network work?
- Key components of a neural network:
    - **Neurons**: These are the basic processing units. They receive inputs, apply activation functions, and produce outputs.
    - **Connections**: Neurons are interconnected via weighted connections.
    - **Weights and Biases**: These regulate information transfer between neurons.
    - **Activation Functions**: Determine whether the neuron "fires" based on its input.
    - **Learning Rule**: Adjusts weights and biases during training.
 
- The process:
    - **Input Computation**: Neurons receive input data.
    - **Output Generation**: Neurons process the input and produce an output.
    - **Iterative Refinement**: The network adjusts weights and biases to improve performance over time.
 
### Types of neural networks
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**: Simplest type, with layers of interconnected neurons. Used for tasks like image classification.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for image processing. Utilize convolutional layers to extract features.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Handle sequential data (e.g., time series, natural language). Have loops to maintain memory.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A type of RNN with improved memory handling.

### Evolution of Neural Network
_Certainly! The evolution of neural networks is fascinating journey that has transformed simple models into powerful architectures. Let's explore this tapestry:_
1. **Early Beginnings: Perceptron**
    - In the 1940s, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduced the **perceptron**, a basic neural network model inspired by the human brain.
    - The perceptron had two inputs and a single output, mimicking a simple decision-making process.
    - However, its limitations (e.g., inability to handle non-linear problems) led to its decline.
  
2. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
    - In the 1960s, the **multilayer perceptron** emerged, allowing for deeper architectures.
    - MLPs introduced hidden layers between input and output layers, enabling complex transformations.
    - Despite advancements, training deep networks remained challenging due to the **vanishing gradient problem**.
  
3. **Backpropagation and Activation Functions**
    - In the 1980s, **Backpropagation** became a breakthrough. It allowed efficient weight updates during training.
    - Activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU) were introduced to introduce non-linearity.
    - These developments paved the way for deeper networks.
  
4. **Deep Learning Renaissance**
    - The 2000s saw a resurgence of interest in neural networks, thanks to **deep learning**.
    - Researchers like Geoffrey Hinton and Yenn LeCun contributed significantly.
    - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** revolutionized image recognition, while **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** handled sequential data.
  
5. **Complex Architectures**
    - **Autoencoders**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)** improved memory handling.
    - **Attention mechanisms** enhanced sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., machine translation).
    - **Transformer architectures** (e.g., BERT, GPT) achieved state-of-the-art result in NLP.
  
6. **Current Landscape**
    - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** create realistic images.
    - **Capsule Networks** aim to address limitations of CNNs.
    - **Graph neural networks** handle graph-structured data.
