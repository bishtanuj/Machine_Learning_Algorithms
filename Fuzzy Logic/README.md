# _Fuzzy Logic_

> _**Fuzzy Logic** is a fascinating concept that provides a flexible way to reason about imprecise or incertain information._

### Definition and Purpose
- _**Fuzzy Logic** is a form of many-valued logic where the truth values of variables can be any real number between 0 and 1, rather than just the traditional true or false values._
- _It deals with situations where we can't definitively determine whether a state is true or false, allowing for shades of gray in between._
- _Fuzzy Logic is used to represent vagueness and uncertainity in decision-making._

### Membership Function
- The fundamental concept in Fuzzy Logic is the **membership function**. It defines the degree of membership of an input value to a certain set or category.
- The membership function maps an input value to a membership degree between 0 and 1, where 0 represents non-membership and 1 represents full membership.

### Fuzzy Rules and Architecture
- Fuzzy Logic is implemented using **Fuzzy Rules**, which are if-then statements expressing relationships between input and output variables in a fuzzy way.
- The architecture includes four parts:
    - **Rule Base**: Contains the set of rules based on linguistic information provided by experts.
    - **Fuzzification**: Converts crisp inputs (exact measurements from sensors) into fuzzy sets.
    - **Inference Engine**: Applies fuzzy rules to make decisions.
    - **Defuzzification**: Converts fuzzy output into crisp values.
