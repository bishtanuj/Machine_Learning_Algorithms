# _Random Forest Algorithm_

_Random forest is a colleborative team of decision trees that work together to provide a single output. Originating in 2001 by Leo Breiman, Random Forest has become a cornerstone for machine learning enthusiasts._

### Working of Random Forest Algorithm
- During training, Random Forest creates multiple decision trees.
- Each tree is constructed using random subset of the dataset and a random subset of features.
- This randomness introduces variability among individual trees, reducing overfitting and improving prediction performance.
- In prediction, the algorithm aggregates results from all trees (voting for classification tasks or averaging for regression tasks).

### Why Random Forest?
- **Robustness**: Handles complex data, noisy features, and outliers effectively.
