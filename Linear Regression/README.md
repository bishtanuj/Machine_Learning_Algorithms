# _Linear Regression_

_**Linear Regression** computes the linear relationship between a **dependent variable** (also known as the response or target variable) and one or more **independent features** (also called explanatory or predictor variables). The goal is to fit a linear equation to observed data, allowing us to make predictions on new datasets._
