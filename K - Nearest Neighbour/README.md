# K - Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
* It is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. 
* The algorithm is used when the datapoints are distributed are distributed non-linearly.
* The algorithm is used both for classification and regression.
* In case of outliers or class inbalance problems, KNN can give inaccurate result.
* The distance matrix used in KNN is euclidian distance, which is used to calculate the distance between any two points.


## Advantages of KNN
1. KNN is easy to implement.
2. It requires only two parameter, value of K and the distance function.
3. New data can be added easily because it is a lazy learner, because it does no training at all when you supply the training data. At the training time, all it is doing is storing the complete dataset, but it doesn't do any calculation at this point.
4. No assumption about the data.
5. Quick calculation time.
