# K - Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
* It is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. 
* The algorithm is used when the datapoints are distributed are distributed non-linearly.
* The algorithm is used both for classification and regression.
* In case of outliers or class inbalance problems, KNN can give inaccurate result.
* The distance matrix used in KNN is euclidian distance, which is used to calculate the distance between any two points.
