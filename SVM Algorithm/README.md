# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm
* SVM is a orginally a binary classifiaction method that divides the given data into two groups in the best possibe way by using hyperplanes.
* A support vector machine (SVM) is a discriminitive classifier formally defined by a separarting hyperplane.
* In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.
* Support Vector Machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression.
* Majorly used for classification.
