# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm
* SVM is a orginally a binary classifiaction method that divides the given data into two groups in the best possibe way by using hyperplanes.
* A support vector machine (SVM) is a discriminitive classifier formally defined by a separarting hyperplane.
* In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.
* Support Vector Machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification and regression.
* Majorly used for classification.


## Support Vector
* Support Vector are data points that are closer to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientaion of the hyperplane.
* Using these support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier.
* Deleting the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane.


## Hyperplane
* Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points.
* Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes.
* In simple term, it is the ability of machine learning model to correctly differentiate/separate/classify between different groups of data. 


## Properties of Support Vector Machine
1. SVM is a maximum separator algorithm.
2. SVM is a kernel based technique.
3. SVM also operates with the high dimensional data and in turn prevents the curse of dimensionality issue.
