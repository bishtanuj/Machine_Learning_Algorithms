# _Naive Bayes Classifier_

_Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes' Theorem. Although they are not a single algorithm, they share a common principle: **every pair of features being classified is independent of each other**_

### Why "Naive"?
- The "naive" part of the name indicates the simplifying assumptions made by the Naive Bayes classifier.
- It assumes that the features used to describe an observation are **conditionally independent**, given the class label.
- Despite this simplification, Naive Bayes remains practical and effective.

## Applications
