# _Logistic Regression_

_**Logistic regression** analyzes the relationship between independent features and a **binary** dependent variable (such as yes/no, true/false, spam/not spam). Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts **probabilities** within the range of 0 to 1. It's like fitting an "S" - shaped curve (the **sigmoid function**) to the data, allowing us to estimate the likelihood of an instance belonging to a specific class._
