# _Logistic Regression_

_**Logistic regression** analyzes the relationship between independent features and a **binary** dependent variable (such as yes/no, true/false, spam/not spam). Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts **probabilities** within the range of 0 to 1. It's like fitting an "S" - shaped curve (the **sigmoid function**) to the data, allowing us to estimate the likelihood of an instance belonging to a specific class._

### Types of Logistic Regression
- **Binomial**: For binary outcomes (e.g., pass/fail, spam/not spam).
- **Multinomial**: For more than two unordered classess (e.g., animal types: cat, dog, sheep).
- **Ordinal**: For ordered classes (e.g., low, medium, high).
