# K - Mean Algorithm
- It is a clustering algorithm - an unsupervised learning approach.
- Aims to partition 'n' observations into K clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
- K - Mean falls under the category of centroid based clustering.
- The three required information to proceed in the algorithm are as follows - <br>
&emsp; 1. n = number of instances <br>
&emsp; 2. k = number of clusters <br>
&emsp; 3. t = number of iterations 

## Steps of Algorithm
### Step 1: Choose the value of Hyperparameter (k)
